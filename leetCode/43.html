<body>
Given two numbers represented as strings, return multiplication of the numbers as a string.

Note:
The numbers can be arbitrarily large and are non-negative.
Converting the input string to integer is NOT allowed.
You should NOT use internal library such as BigInteger.

    var multiply = function(num1, num2) {
        var total = 0;
        for(var i=0; i<num1; i++){
            total += 1*num2;
        }
        return total.toString();
    };
    console.log(multiply());
